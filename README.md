_Smart Inventory Liquidation: Dynamic Markdown Optimization for Perishable Items in Small Retail Chains_

### Business Problem:
Small and mid-sized grocery retailers often suffer losses due to unsold perishable goods. The challenge is to set the right discount level at the right time before product expiry so that you can maximize sell-through while reducing waste and avoiding excessive profit loss.

### Objective:
Build an AI system that optimizes markdown timing and discount percentage for perishable products to maximize sell-through rate while minimizing waste and margin loss.
